      "article": "A selloff in technology stocks dragged on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday, with investors also cautious about brewing U.S.-China tensions at a time when policymakers are attempting to revive the global economy from a coronavirus-driven slump.Amazon.com, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc, which have led a recent rally, weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, while healthcare and technology stocks - which outperformed in the coronavirus-led market slump - were among the S&P 500 sector indexes in the red.On the other hand, travel-related stocks including airlines, cruise companies and hotel operators jumped between 2.4% and 4.5% after taking a beating earlier this year due to a virtual halt in global travel.\"(Traders are focusing on) the progress made in fighting the coronavirus and optimism that we can see past this very sharp downturn and return to a more normal state sometime in the second half of the year,\" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at multi-asset manager QMA in Newark, New Jersey.The easing of lockdowns, optimism about an eventual COVID-19 vaccine and massive US stimulus have powered a recent stock market rally, helping the S&P 500 end on Tuesday at its highest level since early March.However, Sino-U.S. worries have kept a lid on further gains, with President Donald Trump saying Washington would announce its response to China's planned national security legislation on Hong Kong before the end of the week.At 10:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 177.27 points, or 0.71%, at 25,172.38, the S&P 500 was down 2.28 points, or 0.08%, at 2,989.49, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 116.61 points, or 1.25%, at 9,223.61.Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc slipped 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, after Trump threatened to shutter social media companies a day after Twitter prompted readers to fact check his tweets.Walt Disney Co was set to announce its proposal for a phased reopening of its Orlando, Florida, theme parks to a local task force on Wednesday. Its shares gained 1.1%.Investor attention will now turn to the U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book of economic condition scheduled for release at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT).Advancing issues outnumbered decliners nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE and matched them on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and six new lows.\u00a0.reckoner_bx{ background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 20px; font: 400 16px/22px 'Noto Serif',arial; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;}.reckoner_bx .rek_title{font: 700 18px/25px 'Fira Sans',arial; color: #0155A0; margin-bottom: 7px; text-transform: uppercase;}.reckoner_bx .btn_reck{border-radius: 20px; background-color: #135B9D; display: inline-block; font: 700 14px/19px 'Noto Serif',arial; padding: 8px 25px; color: #fff !important; text-decoration: none !important;}.reckoner_bx .rek_btnbx{ margin-top: 10px; }.reckoner_bx .bldcls{font-weight: bold;}Coronavirus Essential | Lockdown might be extended to June 15 as cases cross 1.5 lakh; India number may peak in July, experts say Copyright \u00a9 e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The company, which had reported a net profit of Rs 37.6 crore during the corresponding quarter last fiscal, has announced distribution of Rs 3 per unit to its investors for the period under review.Revenues for the quarter increased to Rs 328.4 crore from Rs 170.5 crore in Q4 FY2019, mainly on the back of value accretive acquisitions made by the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) during the fiscal.\"The landscape of power transmission remains one of the safest sectors to remain invested to attract private capital. Even during the current COVID scenario, since transmission was also declared as an essential service and is not linked to power flow, so our revenues have not been impacted,\" IndiGrid CEO Harsh Shah told reporters during a post-results conference call.For the fiscal 2020, the company reported revenues of Rs 1,242.7 crore and a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 505.7 crore, as against Rs 665.6 crore and Rs 153.9 crore respectively in FY2019.With distribution of Rs 3 per unit for the quarter, IndiGrid has delivered on its guidance of Rs 12 per unit for FY20. Including this distribution, the company has distributed Rs 33.56 per unit, delivering a total return of 32 per cent since listing three years ago.\"This has been a transformational year for IndiGrid which saw accretive and sizeable asset acquisitions of over Rs 6,200 crore leading to a more than twofold jump in distributable cash flows to Rs 720 crore for the financial year.\"This was made possible on back of successful preferential allotment of Rs 2,510 crore equity from long term investors such as KKR, GIC and other capital market investors,\" Shah added.On the company's outlook for FY2021, he said IndiGrid is evaluating selective acquisition opportunities in the solar sector with state-run firms like NTPC and SECI.\"While we would continue to remain a transmission utility, we intend to expand in the solar space. We have not yet acquired any asset but we have an opportunistic mindset that if there are good projects available at high return we would consider those...we are seeking solar assets with government-backed counterparties, such as NTPC and SECI,\" Shah added.Over the past three years, the company's assets under management (AUM) have grown from Rs 3,700 crore to Rs 12,000 crore.\"With a strong shareholder base and favorable regulatory environment, we remain committed to having an AUM of Rs 30,000 crore over the next two years as we acquire projects under framework agreement and beyond.\"Our outlook for FY21 remains positive where in addition to the portfolio growth and robust asset management, our focus will be on sustainability, maintaining adequate liquidity to mitigate current uncertainties as well as strengthening balance sheet,\" he said.The company is focusing on diligence and monitoring of framework assets worth Rs 6,500 crore of Sterlite Power's Gurgaon Palwal Transmission (GPTL), Khargone Transmission (KTL) and NERSS.\"We want to create a pipeline of transmission projects besides the existing pipeline of projects.

      "article": "While radio listenership has grown in times of COVID-19, revenue has been hit hard.According to an Elara Capital research note, the radio industry has reported a revenue decline of 80-85 percent year-on-year to date, due to the pan-India lockdown.Pressure persists on the corporate ad front and the segment may continue to underperform for radio in comparison to other media, the note said.\u201cThe worst hit would be local advertisers which contribute 40 percent to radio ads; they will also take the longest to recover. This, in turn, will lead to curb on ads for a long time,\u201d said Karan Taurani, Vice President, Elara Capital.Recently, Association of Radio Operators for India (AROI) had written to the government urging for an economic survival package for FM radio.The association has requested for one year waiver of license fee; payments on rentals and other charges to Prasar Bharti and Becil; one year free spectrum and waiver of spectrum fees; zero or five percent GST; restoration of government advertising to normal levels; full waiver of minimum guarantee i.e. 2.5 percent of one time entry fees till end of license period; and two year extension in terms of license period.These waivers will cost the government around Rs 300 crore.In the letter, the association pointed out that the radio industry is looking at a loss of Rs 600 crore till September this year due to drop in advertisements.Many of the top advertising categories on radio have been hit hard due to coronavirus including auto, and real estate. Plus, government ad spend, which is another important category for radio, has dropped as much as 80 percent, say industry players.The note\u00a0pointed out that the government vertical at five to six percent contribution has bottomed and it is social awareness campaigns on COVID-19 safety measures that is supporting the segment.The top five advertising categories \u2013 real estate, government, auto, pharma, consumer electricals and durables \u2013 contribute 40 percent of ad volume for the radio industry.One respite for the radio industry is the resumption of economic activities in Tier II and III markets, which are declared green zones, the note said.\u201cThis will provide some respite for regional radio firms having a higher market share than larger radio networks, which derive almost two thirds of their revenue from the top eight to 10 stations which are more focused on metro cities.\u201d.reckoner_bx{ background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 20px; font: 400 16px/22px 'Noto Serif',arial; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;}.reckoner_bx .rek_title{font: 700 18px/25px 'Fira Sans',arial; color: #0155A0; margin-bottom: 7px; text-transform: uppercase;}.reckoner_bx .btn_reck{border-radius: 20px; background-color: #135B9D; display: inline-block; font: 700 14px/19px 'Noto Serif',arial; padding: 8px 25px; color: #fff !important; text-decoration: none !important;}.reckoner_bx .rek_btnbx{ margin-top: 10px; }.reckoner_bx .bldcls{font-weight: bold;}Coronavirus Essential | Lockdown might be extended to June 15 as cases cross 1.5 lakh; India number may peak in July, experts say Copyright \u00a9 e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

She also appreciated the leadership role played at the New Development Bank (NDB) by Indian banker K V Kamath, who will be leaving the institution as president on completion of his term.Marcos Troyjo from Brazil has been elected as the new president of NDB, and will replace Kamath, who was appointed as the head of the institution for five years in 2015.The special meeting of the Board of Governors of NDB, held through video-conference, also approved the appointment of Anil Kishora as vice president and Chief Risk Officer.In her remarks at the meeting, Sitharaman appreciated Kamath for his stellar stewardship in very quickly giving shape to the vision stated by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) leaders in 2014.The swift response to coronavirus pandemic through launch of the COVID-19 Emergency Programme Loan product will be remembered as one of his contributions, she added.She commended the contribution of NDB in funding the infrastructure development, which has positively impacted the development agenda of the member countries, including India.Within a short span of time, NDB has approved 55 projects of member countries for an amount of $16.6 billion, which is quite a remarkable achievement.Sitharaman also mentioned that the bank has successfully created a niche for itself and proudly stands shoulder to shoulder with the peer MDBs (multilateral development banks).While congratulating the new team, Sitharaman remarked that she has great expectations from the new leadership in continuing this momentum forward and taking NDB to the next level in terms of lending performance to members, transparency, international credibility and effectively achieving the NDB mandate.The NDB was established by the BRICS countries in 2014.

      "article": "A Chinese survey team on Wednesday reached Mount Everest through Tibet to remeasure the exact height of the world's tallest mountain.According to China's measurement, the height of Mount Everest is 8844.43 meters which is four meters less than Nepal's calculations, the state media reported.On May 1, China, which differs with Nepal over the height of Mount Everest, began a new survey to measure the altitude of the world's highest peak.The event marked a crucial step in China's mission to remeasure the height of the world's highest peak, which scientists believe will enhance human knowledge of nature and help boost scientific development, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.After summiting, team members began erecting a survey marker on the snow-covered peak, which measures less than 20 square meters, the report said.Chinese surveyors have conducted six rounds of scaled measurement and scientific research on Mt Everest and released the height of the peak twice in 1975 and 2005, which was 8,848.13 meters and 8,844.43 meters respectively, the report said.In Tibetan language, Mount Everest is known as Mount Qomolangma.\"The changes of Mount Qomolangma are of key significance to the global studies of geology and ecology, and have a major impact on people's lives,\" said Chen Gang, an engineer with the Ministry of Natural Resources.Mount Everest is located in the collision and compression zone between the edges of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate, where crustal movement is very active.\"Accurately measuring the height of Mount Qomolangma is helpful to the study of the elevation changes of the Himalayas and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,\" Gao Dengyi, an atmospheric physicist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences said.The team members remained at the summit for two and a half hours, a new record for Chinese climbers.China and Nepal settled their border dispute in 1961 with the boundary line passing through the summit of Mount Everest.More and more international climbers are reportedly using the Tibetan side of Mount Everest as China has improved infrastructure facilities compared to that of Nepal.China which closed Qomolangma National Park in southwest China''s Tibet Autonomous Region as a precaution following the coronavirus outbreak reopened it on May 1 coinciding with May Day holidays.Nepal closed all of its Himalayan peaks including Mount Everest in March in view of the coronavirus outbreak.Chinese tech firm Huawei is working with China Mobile to build two 5G stations on Mount Everest.The stations are expected to cover the summit of the mountain. The two installations will be the world's highest terrestrial 5G base stations, Global Times reported on May 1.\"The 6,500-meter-high point will likely be the highest place where Huawei is able to build a 5G station, but whether the signal can extend as high as the summit at 8,848 meters still needs to be tested. We are striving to make that happen,\" Zhang Bo, Huawei project manager said..reckoner_bx{ background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 20px; font: 400 16px/22px 'Noto Serif',arial; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;}.reckoner_bx .rek_title{font: 700 18px/25px 'Fira Sans',arial; color: #0155A0; margin-bottom: 7px; text-transform: uppercase;}.reckoner_bx .btn_reck{border-radius: 20px; background-color: #135B9D; display: inline-block; font: 700 14px/19px 'Noto Serif',arial; padding: 8px 25px; color: #fff !important; text-decoration: none !important;}.reckoner_bx .rek_btnbx{ margin-top: 10px; }.reckoner_bx .bldcls{font-weight: bold;}Coronavirus Essential | Lockdown might be extended to June 15 as cases cross 1.5 lakh; India number may peak in July, experts say Copyright \u00a9 e-Eighteen.com Ltd.
